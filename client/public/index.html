      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <meta name="description" content="The idea is a website where different crypto communities can register and mint NFTs to distribute or sell to members of their communities (as a way of supporting their activities). The NFTs will have a central identity and a section of the visual design that will be affected by the characteristics of each community. These NFTs are unique for each community and the amount that each community will be able to mint will depend on a bonding curve that will define the relationship between the order in which a community registers to mint and the supply of a their unique NFT they would be able to mint. The idea behind is to reward with scarcer NFTs the communities the register and mint first, the early adopters." />
